Having large consumer satisfaction develops towards a stronger reputation and larger sales for a product. On the other hand, having access to direct feedback on the product means that the company will be able to collect data to determine areas of improvement for the future. For video games in particular, this is especially important. All types of video games, ranging from Triple-A games with large budgets to small indie games, will encounter bugs and glitches that ruin the player's experience. These bugs will need to be fixed in future patches, and depending on speed and quality, will affect a game's success. Being able to receive consumer criticism on how a game is doing will allow for developers to know what they are doing right and what needs to be brought to their attention, with urgency increasing with frequency in reviews. Having many good reviews posted by consumers following update changes increase the chance of convincing other potential buyers to purchase the game with the appeal of responsive developers.\n","\n","Consumer reviews come in many different mediums, ranging from visual videos to forum posts, social media, review blogs, and direct store page reviews. This analysis will focus on direct store page text reviews because the store page is a central location where users that have purchased and played the game, and have the intent of sharing their experience or feedback with the developer and interested consumers prior to their purchase. There is generally an option to select whether the user is recommending the game or not. However, being able to classify a review as a recommendation or not will allow for mediums that are not specifically designed for consumer reviews (social media posts, forum posts, video/video comments, etc.) to still be an option for data collection as input. Also, this can be applied to store pages with a 'no recommendation response' option, and the page may find that they wish to automatically determine or suggest whether a review is recommending a game or not. \n","\n","This notebook will be using NLP and sentiment analysis to classify whether a game review has positive or negative sentiments, while also demonstrating the data science life cycle. The dataset will be reviews from the Steam store, which is a digital hub for video games. There is a dedicated section for each video game store page where consumers can write a review. Steam was chosen because it already provides the recommendation status for each review by the reviewer, which is perfect for supervised learning.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MSbMFGXnKtu7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### General and Web Scraping Library Imports"],"metadata":{"id":"evzjFuxzNeqm"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":111,"metadata":{"id":"jOYIrZYVE1Tm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1640059049864,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":155,"user":{"displayName":"John Le","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"05286054622375078735"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["#Web Scraping: requests for GET requests, \n","#beautifulsoup for handling scraped data, json for formatting,\n","#regex for matching patterns from data observations\n","import requests\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","import json\n","import re \n","\n","#Computational and Data Handling libraries\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Data Collection\n","The first step will be deciding which games to scrape reviews from. The goal is to choose games that vary in recommendations and non-recommendation reviews, while also choosing games that have a decent amount of reviews. I decided to scrape data on the top 1000 games ranked by current players from https://steamcharts.com/top. Although ranking by current players may cause inconsistency, the \"Peak Players\" column has values high enough that suggest sufficient reviews. Games with lower peak players/current players count may help with getting negative reviews, but could also cause a shortage of review observations.
